# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is a block of code designed to do a specific task.  you would use one whenever you needed to do something specific.

  Researched answer: functions are created to do a specific task. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.  in JS, 
  functions are also objects.



2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: push()=>adds to end of array; pop()=>removes from end of array; unshift() => adds to beginning of array; shift() => removes from beginning of array
  reverse()=> reverse the order of elements in an array

  Researched answer: (in addition to the ones mentioned) concat() => merges 2 arrays; filter() => creates a new array with all values that passed the 
  filtering function; indexOf() => searches the array for an element and returns the first index it appears at; lastIndexOf() => same as indexOf() except
  it returns the last index it appears at; map() => creates a new array with the results of the function that acted on the original element



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() outputs a string to the console.  return is used in functions for its output

  Researched answer: console.log() writes to the console. The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: argument is actual the input to the function. an argument can only be used in the input of the function where variables can be used wherever.

  Researched answer: function arguments are the real values passed to a function.  variables are containers for storing data.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: one person types and one person dictates.

  Researched answer:the driver writes the code while the other reviews each line of code.  the programmers switch roles often.
